    "description": "[WHAT WE DID]\n\nGuest voter selection for Retro 5, was based on software development expertise evident by a developer's Github user reputation score, under the guidance of Optimism Citizens House. The developer reputation scores are based on calculating recursive trust across the Github developer activity graph. This ranking is seeded by OP Stack repos. This means Github repos and developers \n\nThis was an important experiment because certain retro funding rounds, such as this round, has particular expertise involved in assessing and judging the quality and impact of the applicant projects. In the case of Retro 5, the applicants are repos to OP Stack, therefore it makes sense to select top contributing and highly reputable developers as guest voters, so that the collective governance can benefit from their technical and topical expertise. are scored based on recursive trust signals, originating from these seed trust repos. https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-expert-voting-experiment/8613\n\nMore on our effort into applying the algorithm in custom context, pre and post processing the data, and iterations: https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-guest-voter-selection-algorithm-explanation/8719\n\n[OUR IMPACT] \n\n30 top contributors to OP stack were identified and selected as expert voters for Retro 5 round - OP Stack.\n\n74K+ Github developers were given a reputation score seeded to indicate their contribution, taken into consideration the quality of their code contribution, to Optimism core repo stacks. And the score results are readily available for any Optimism ecosystem projects to use.\n\n[WHAT IS OpenRank]\n\nOpenRank is a decentralized ranking and reputation protocol. It enables a verifiable reputation compute layer for the open web that unlocks a broad range of useful applications, including those that resist cryptographic or game-theoretic mechanisms of trust.

Its strength lies in its flexibility and high customization, catering to the diverse needs of its users. This includes options for calculating users' voting power, selecting different voting mechanisms, and managing proposal and vote validation rules.\n\nAs the gas cost dropped with the maturity of L2s and the need for more decentralized and trustless voting grew, we developed Snapshot X, an onchain voting protocol. Unlike the original Snapshot, Snapshot X operates fully onchain using a set of modular smart contracts. This shift makes Snapshot censorship resistant, with onchain and cross-chain voting power computation and trustless execution, while keeping gas costs to the minimal extent possible.",

This widespread adoption positions Snapshot as the leading governance platform with the most impact within the Superchain ecosystem.\n\nWith the launch of Snapshot X, our onchain governance framework, we expect many of these users to transition from offchain to onchain voting. In particular, those using voting power from OP or Base are likely to vote on these chains, significantly increasing onchain governance activity, directly benefiting the entire Optimism Collective.",

      "description": "Giveth is an open-source, radically transparent, user-friendly donation platform that supports verified public goods projects to raise crypto with zero added fees and no intermediaries. We build and advance novel fundraising mechanisms like quadratic funding, donor rewards, and decentralized project curation.\n\n## Giveth supports P2P donations on Optimism and Base.  \n\nGiveth has been live on Optimism since 2023, enabling projects to accept Optimism donations (approx. $330k USD raised by hundreds of projects on OP Mainnet as of June 5, 2024). Donations on Giveth are truly P2P without even contracts in the middle, so the donations we facilitate in the platform can't be included in our metrics in this application.\n\nThrough our GIVbacks program, we reward donors to verified projects with GIV on Optimism, having distributed  6.64 million GIV on OP Mainnet (from launch to June 11, 2024).  \n\nAs an additional onboarding effort for high-trust community members, we have been offering 25 OP to each project on Giveth who passes our verification system requirements, and adds an Optimism recipient address (296 projects onboarded so far). \n\nTo enhance these onboarding efforts, we have been running quadratic funding rounds that require verified projects to add an Optimism address, with matching pools on Optimism so far totaling approximately $83,000. \n\n## How it works\n\nGiveth goes beyond ‚Äújust donations‚Äù with the following features:\n\n* GIVbacks - Donors who give to verified public goods projects get rewarded with GIV on OP Mainnet. This flips the script on tax-deductible donation, creating a decentralized and borderless way of incentivizing donations.\n* GIVpower - Users can lock their GIV tokens on OP Mainnet to earn a yield and get GIVpower. People can use GIVpower to boost/curate projects on the platform. Projects with more GIVpower are ranked higher, and in turn, their donors are rewarded with more GIVbacks, similar to the veToken model. Top-boosted projects also appear higher on Giveth!\n* Quadratic Funding - The democratic matching program popularized by Gitcoin is also available on Giveth! Projects and donors enjoy multi-chain donation rounds with an easy and streamlined user experience.\n\n## Who uses it\n\nCurrently, over 3,400 projects have raised $2.8m from 58,600+ donations from over 16,600 donor addresses on Giveth. \n\nTo understand how deep our link with the Optimism ecosystem is, if we consider only Optimism numbers, we have 799 projects, 4012 donors, 17,500+ donations, and $329k+.\n\nProjects that want to get to the next level can apply to be ‚ÄúVerified‚Äù as a public goods creator, providing information about their impact history and reputation at stake.\n\nGiveth is onboarding real-world impact projects to web3 by empowering them with free access to novel fundraising mechanisms and new ecosystems of donors, while inspiring them to dive deeper down the blockchain rabbit hole.\n\nSo far in 2024, we have made HUGE progress, running four quadratic funding rounds supporting donations on Optimism with the following results:\n\nTotal in matching pools: $107,563\nIndividual donations: $65,500\nProjects participating: 249 \nUnique donors: 1914\nDonations: 1433\n\nGiving Season Round  (December 19, 2023 - January 2, 2024)\nhttps://forum.giveth.io/t/qf-giving-season-round-results-december-19-2023-january-2-2024/1305\n\nMetaPool APAC Round (February 19-29, 2024)\nhttps://forum.giveth.io/t/meta-pool-apac-qf-round-results-feb-19-29-2024/1358\n\nENS Builders Round (March 25-April 8, 2024)\nhttps://forum.giveth.io/t/ens-builders-qf-round-march-25-april-8-2024/1410\n\nGalactic Giving Round (May 2-16, 2024)\nhttps://forum.giveth.io/t/galactic-giving-round-results-may-2-16-2024/1445\n\nWe also launched loads of features including a custom donation widget, a project curation program, and streaming donations.\n\nWe sincerely thank the Optimistic community for allowing us to participate and build in such a fantastic ecosystem.\n",

    "name": "DeVouch powered by Giveth",
    "description": "Giveth is an open-source, radically transparent, user-friendly donation platform that supports and verifies public goods projects, enabling them to raise crypto with zero added fees and no intermediaries. Today, Giveth supports donations on OP Mainnet, Ethereum Mainnet, Base, Celo, as well as 7 other chains, and several OP Governance projects, such as growthepie, DAOstar, Pairwise, Praise & EAS raise funds on our platform.\n\nRecently, in coordination with the Optimism Token House, we launched DeVouch, a system for members of reputable organizations in the Ethereum ecosystem to vouch for projects looking to raise funding. It was created with special attention to the Optimism Retro Funding mechanism.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nBy vouching for a project, the organization can lend its credibility to the project, building confidence for those looking to support it with funding.\n\nDeVouch collects projects from Gitcoin, Giveth, and Optimism Retro Funding rounds and showcases them in a single place, allowing all users to either vouch for or flag each project. Visitors to the website can see the vouches and flags received by each project, which were tracked by the \"Attester Group\" that the vouch or flag came from. \n\nAttester Groups are formed by looking at on-chain Attestation Data from EAS on Optimism to know who belongs to which organization or community sub-set by which Attestations have been issued to them and by whom. An example of Attester Groups are RetroFunding 5 voters or Gitcoin passport holders.\n\nThis allows members of these groups to lend their reputation to the project looking for funding. However, attesting with DeVouch is a double-edged sword, if a project seems suspicious or untrustworthy then they could also receive a flag, warning others to think twice before supporting this project.\n\nDeVouch is open-source and allows any platform or individual to query DeVouch data using our graphQL API as well as contribute by the issuance of attestations using the DeVouch schema. Anyone can also add their Attester Group to DeVouch by making a simple PR on the DeVouch Github Repository\n\nWho uses it?\n\nDeVouch was launched in early June 2024, and has been featured as additional tooling in Retro Funding 5. Giveth is also integrating it to provide Decentralized Verification of projects seeking funding on the platform.\n\nConsidering that we launched on June 12th of this year, the over 700 onchain attestations that‚Äôve happened through DeVouch before September 18th shows that there are good expectations, regarding the growth of users.\n\nAlso, to map potential, we look at the demand for such a service, and specifically with Optimism, we have over 591 projects (according to Alchemy) between dApps, dexes, etc., which are all looking to take fundraising opportunities and a piece of the $3.3B in Public Goods funding that was set aside by the Optimism Collective. \n\nA decentralized vouching system is essential to bringing more efficiency to allocating funds, as well as to map the reputation of each project by the entire Optimism Community. Is a project a scam? Flag it! Is a project legit? Vouch for it!\n\nGiveth is known for its ability to support projects in their fundraising effort, and yes from October 2023 until September 18th 2024 we facilitated nearly $1M of donations to projects on our platform, and rewarded donors via our GIVbacks program. But our efforts to verify projects are legitimate is often forgotten. With DeVouch, we are decentralizing this effort and enabling other programs, especially in the Superchain, to also verify that the projects applying for funding are legitimate.",

DeVouch made tweets tagging every project that applied in RF5. If impersonation occurred, the project would have seen the tweet, flagged it on DeVouch and reported it.\n\nProjects have a simple way to prove their legitimacy in an industry ripe with scams.

    "description": "GovXS is an initiative under Token Engineering Academy, which is a proud recipient of Optimism RetroPGF funding in Rounds 2 and 3. \n\nGovXS was selected to complete the Optimism Foundation‚Äôs Mission Request #188‚ÄìEvaluating Voting Design Tradeoffs for Retro Funding in June 2024. Our team of 4 experts in social choice theory, modeling and simulations, and token engineering (Nimrod Talmon, PhD, Angela Kreitenweis, Eyal Briman, and Muhammad Idrees) has now gone beyond the Mission Request‚Äôs scope to analyze actual Optimism Retro Funding voting designs and improve governance performance by proposing new, strategyproof voting rules.\n\n**Deliverables by September 18:**\n\n- Voting Design Mathematical Specification:\nDeriving the formal specification of the exact voting rules applied in Optimism‚Äôs Retro Funding Rounds 1‚Äì4 (R1‚Äì4) to allow for rigorous, axiomatic analysis\n\n- Voting Design Evaluation Framework:\nDeriving a 360¬∞ evaluation framework based on Optimism Retro Funding objectives\n\n- Voting Design Evaluation Metrics:\nDeveloping metrics to rigorously verify voting designs against Retro Funding objectives, applying theoretical, axiomatic analysis and agent-based simulations \n\n- Testing and Verification of Optimism‚Äôs R1‚Äì4 Voting Rules:\nVerifying if the R1‚Äì4 voting rules satisfy Incentive Compatibility so that voters can not improve their results by lying about their preferences (known as ‚Äústrategyproofness‚Äù in social choice theory)\n\n- Detection of Major Flaws in Optimism Retro Funding:\nWe found major flaws in the Optimism Retro Funding voting designs (none of the R1‚Äì4 voting designs satisfy strategyproofness!)\n\n- Provided 2 Strategyproof Solutions:\nGovXS proposed two alternative voting designs to solve strategyproofness and meet Optimism Retro Funding‚Äôs design goals \n\n** Links:** \n1) Making Optimism Retro Funding Strategyproof (Report) ‚Äì https://mirror.xyz/0x803860D2C333734cD99625d8d189d0Eb2e565166/gvjQpafjVxAeeQnb7_Oc--5Oc7chV55zwR_NCa1_9KU\n\n2) A Social Choice Analysis of Retroactive Funding (PDF) ‚Äì https://github.com/GovXS/Evaluating-Voting-Design-Tradeoffs-for-Retro-Funding/blob/main/A%20Social%20Choice%20Analysis%20of%20Retroactive%20Funding.pdf\n\n3) GovXS Retro Funding Simulator (Open-source) ‚Äì¬†https://github.com/GovXS/Evaluating-Voting-Design-Tradeoffs-for-Retro-Funding\n\n\n**Positive impact:**\n\n- Securing Truthful Voting:\nUsing strategyproof voting designs ensures that voters can achieve their best results only by voting according to their true preferences. Current Retro Funding voting designs are not strategyproof. We propose alternative voting designs to solve this issue.\n\n- Securing Expert/Guest Voter Experiments:\nOptimism Retro Funding is running experiments with badgeholders, guest voters, and expert voters, investing sizably to gain insights on how to best select the most knowledgeable, value-aligned voters. These insights rely on learnings from analyzing voting data and voter preferences. If this data is skewed due to voting designs not being strategyproof, wrong conclusions will be drawn, creating negative impacts e.g. on future rounds‚Äô scope and size, or voter and project participation, hurting the entire ecosystem.\n\n- Securing ‚ÄúImpact = Profit‚Äù:\nOptimism's vision is to build a global system where positive impact to the collective is rewarded by profit to the individual, so that ‚ÄúImpact = Profit‚Äù. Retro Funding aims to find the ground truth in funding allocation. There is no instrument or algorithm yet to measure a project‚Äôs positive impact and the respective profit it deserves. That‚Äôs why you, as a voter, are asked to assess project applications by voting in Retro Funding. If the voting rule provides voters with the wrong incentives, the results will be distorted, and Optimism Retro Funding cannot get any closer to reaching a fair, objective truth supporting ‚ÄúImpact = Profit‚Äù.",

Yet, for many delegates, the tools and processes available often feel fragmented, isolated, and hard to navigate. We‚Äôve experienced these challenges firsthand, not just as developers but as participants in various DAOs.\n\nSyntra is a delegate dashboard born from this realization: governance doesn‚Äôt need an isolated tool‚Äîit requires an integrated solution focused on people, the ones driving these organizations forward.\n\nShift in Focus: From Tools to People\n\nFor too long, DAO tooling has been focused on solving specific issues‚Äîone tool for proposals, another for voting, and yet another for analytics. The result? A fragmented experience that leaves participants, both newcomers and experienced teams, struggling to piece together a coherent workflow.\n\nOur Approach\n\nWe knew there had to be a better way, so we asked: What if we could give DAO participants a head start? What if we could streamline these processes, so they can focus on what really matters‚Äîmaking impactful decisions?. Our target user base varies from newcomers to professional delegates leading teams of 10+ members.\n\nFor newcomers: Syntra lowers the barriers to entry, making it easier to draft proposals, post comments, participate in discussions, vote, and analyze governance activity.\nFor professional organizations: It facilitates coordination and collaboration, providing role-based access and tracking tools to streamline internal processes.\nBy integrating many of the existing tools within the DAO ecosystem, we help delegates manage governance processes more efficiently, improving not just individual contributions but also team-based workflows.",

We used the same algorithm used for guest voter selection, but utilize the scores differently to create repo reputations. For example, instead of number of forks, voters can see the number of forks by reputable developers, and they can see the weighted and aggregated reputation scores of all developers who forked this repo. https://gov.optimism.io/t/impact-metrics-for-retro-funding-5/8931\nTL;DR 1min video walk through: https://www.loom.com/share/92ccf283b670477d9bf147f8b66a22e3?sid=9fcf321f-8dd3-4ba7-8221-8a301b9b15d3\n\n[OUR IMPACT] \n\nNow we have reputation scores for 47K repos in Github for their contribution to OP Stack core repos. And these scores are readily available for any developer in OP ecosystem to use.\n\nIntroducing reputation metrics is important because 1) voters need better signals to know if a repo is contributing to OP stack and to what degree is that contribution; 2) voters need signals to know if a repo has been interacted by reputable developers, which adds to an underlying endorsement of the value of the repos. \n\nMore on our work: https://x.com/SahilDewan/status/1839701853258530864\n\n[WHAT IS OpenRank]\n\nOpenRank is a decentralized ranking and reputation protocol. It enables a verifiable reputation compute layer for the open web that unlocks a broad range of useful applications, including those that resist cryptographic or game-theoretic mechanisms of trust.

        "description": "This is the most comprehensive source of truth on Optimism at the moment. It covers the OP Collective from all angles - treasury, token, votes, delegates, delegate coalitions, and place in the ecosystem. Each tab (you can click between them) includes multiple graphs and metrics, providing a nuanced look into the Collective‚Äôs inner workings. Below we have given short description to the sections of this dashboard, to fully illustrate its capabilities.\n\nNote that the entire dashboard is free for everyone. \n\nTreasury\nThe treasury analysis provides a deeper look into what is going inside the Collective‚Äôs treasury. Starting with treasury change over time, it also lists the treasury currencies, and assets. Scrolling down, you can find a treasury composition percentage graph, a month by month total treasury value, and a list of all contracts related to the OP Collective. The contracts are labeled with the appropriate tags (liquid funds, protocol funds, governor, etc.)  \n\nToken\nToken analysis correlates the performance of the governance token ($OP) to governance metrics. The graphs of token price vs successful proposals, and average votes per proposal, help gauge governance sentiment and device plans to ensure a resilient voter set despite market conditions. This tab also includes a list of all DAOs holding the OP token in their treasury. \n\nVoter Trends\nThis tab provides deep insights on voter activity by tracking participation in various timeframes, and types of activity (proposals, avg. votes per proposals, and move). One can see how the total number of votes, voters, and average votes per proposal have changed over the past 3 years. The tab also provides analysis in shorter time frames over the past year, helping the Collective easily measure the impact of community and governance initiatives. \n\nDelegates\nThis is one of the most important sections of OP Collective‚Äôs PRO dashboard. Starting with a table on governance commitment - the tab displays delegates based on their number of delegators, voting power, and recent activity. Then it provides a comprehensive list of the most influential addresses in OP Collective, including delegates, badgeholders, and other stakeholders. What is proprietary and unique to DeepDAO is the historical governance profile for each of these addresses. Clicking on any of these profiles takes one to their profile page on DeepDAO, which displays their aggregate governance activity across the entire DAO ecosystem.  \n\nDelegate Coalitions\nTogether with the delegates dashboard, the Coalitions dashboard provides a look at the people (addresses) that frequently vote together, and their combined power. This is a useful tool for understanding, and acting on the state of power concentration among the collective delegates - beyond any one individual. If one truly wants to know who are the influential delegates, the Coalitions dashboard is the place to look at. \n\nEcosystem\nThe Ecosystem tab (scroll right to find it) provides insights on the place of the collective‚Äôs voters and delegates in the entire DAO ecosystem. It maps voters' interests in DAO sectors (as categorized by DeepDAO), and voters' engagement with other DAOs - the collective‚Äôs competitor, and partner DAOs. These insights provide a larger view on where the collective is, and has the power to feed into the collective's marketing initiatives. "

At the time, I realized there were no public accountability for delegates meanwhile lots of them receive huge amount of votes. And to help the collective better monitor delegates, especially the top 100 of them, I consult with people like Justine (OP head of gov), Ross (a16z), Michael Silberling (OP Data), and lots of delegates on the metrics to track for governance. \n\nThus, I created 2 public dune dashboards for the OP Collective to track the governance \"performance\" of its delegates. One is for the top 100 delegates. The other is for the a16z Optimism Delegates (including university clubs, professional delegate groups, and a few crypto native delegates. They track votes participations, voting powers, voting rationales, and other relevant metrics (on both individual level and the aggregate level). It help the OP collective to identify active and inactive delegates (with lots of voting power) to reward accordingly and conduct liquid delegation when performance degrades. It also help the delegators  such as a16z's and others to know which smaller voting power delegates are active in governance: offering them a platform for delegators to know more about them.   ",

It also examines their engagement in decentralized applications (DEXs), token transfers, and social platforms like Farcaster. \n\nA key insight is the relatively low activity level of Badgeholders compared to Non-Badgeholders, particularly in areas like DEX trading and smart contract deployment. Additionally, the analysis tracks how Badgeholders' preferences for Ethereum transactions and limited cross-chain activity impact their overall engagement with Optimism's governance processes. \n\nThis helps identify where governance structures may need to be adjusted to include better and activate Badgeholders, ensuring their participation grows alongside the broader ecosystem.\n",

For example, understanding that Badgeholders are more active on Ethereum but less engaged with smart contract deployment helps the Collective target these users with specific governance initiatives. \n\nFurthermore, the findings around Farcaster connections show the importance of social engagement within this group, which can shape future governance outreach and participation efforts. The insights have also helped governance teams refine their strategies for promoting cross-chain activity and diversifying user engagement. This research will also guide the future selection of new Badgeholders for the Citizen House by identifying gaps and ensuring the House becomes more inclusive and representative of the entire user profile within the Collective, promoting a well-rounded governance structure.\n",

We have worked collaboratively with the Optimism Foundation to provide a toolkit to measure VBE in both the Citizens House and Token House to study their levels of decentralization. We have also released a public dashboard measuring VBE across DAOs. (Optimism Collective, as it turns out, ranks #1, i.e., has the highest VBE.)\n\nWe can't build truly equitable and durable DAOs unless we understand the meaning of the 'D' in DAO‚Äîthe decentralization part‚Äîand can measure it. Existing metrics‚Äîthe Nakamoto coefficient, the Gini coefficient, etc.‚Äîhave a number of shortcomings. We have proposed a new metric, called voting-block entropy (VBE)‚Äîpronounced \"vibe.\" It measures decentralization in a principled way that avoids the pitfalls of previous metrics and better reflects intuitive notions of decentralization, such as diversity of opinions, credible neutrality, etc.\n\nVBE additionally offers practical guidance for DAO administrators and users. Using VBE as a theoretical foundation, we have proven a number of basic theorems about ways to increase VBE and thus improve decentralization. \n\nOur work on VBE has involved strong collaboration with the Optimism Foundation (OF). In consultation with the OF, we have developed tools for the OF (and other projects) for measuring VBE. We have shared the resulting code for the Optimism-specific VBE toolkit with the Optimism Foundation for their use in analysis of the Optimism DAOs. We have also created a public dashboard at https://tinyurl.com/y2ftwavu that includes up-to-date VBE measurements for a number of major DAOs in the ecosystem. (Optimism, as it turns out, is currently #1, i.e., exhibits the highest VBE.)\n\nOur team consists of researchers associated with Ari Juels's group at Cornell Tech.",

It has been empowering developers with a crypto-native financial primitive, money streaming, and a modular smart contracts framework to build applications that leverage a formula-based balance and gasless, liquid, ongoing value transfer.\n\nOver 49,394 streams have been started on Optimism and 644,584 on Base for a combined total volume of over $280M.\n\nSuperfluid is designed to minimize its TVL in favor of making assets available to sender or recipient at all times, minimizing funds locked in smart contracts. As such its impact is better measures in total volume transferred, number of total or active streams, total number of users and daily active users. When measuring the protocol activity it's important to not only rely on the on-chain transaction to smart contracts, but also on the the inner mechanics of the protocol (i.e. by evaluating the actions triggered via callData or by using the protocol subgraph).\n\nOn the alignment with Optimism and Retro Funding\n- Superfluid is builder-centric. A developer tool with clear focus on onboarding more developers to build more apps. As such, it‚Äôs additive to Optimism‚Äôs own goals.\n- Superfluid is supporting long term, real world use cases, like Salaries, Subscriptions, Memberships, Rentals, Airdrops, Grants distribution as well as entirely novel applications in DeFi, SocialFi and beyond.\n\nSuperfluid Protocol has been used by the Optimism Foundation to stream the RPGF3 & RF4 grants, and will be used again in the upcoming rounds, providing the rails for a seamless funds distribution.\n\nThe protocol has been designed around builders and developers, with a set of tools available for building, debugging and data retrieval that empower new applications development. Here you can see an overview of projects built on Superfluid that have added value (and usage) to the Optimism and Base networks: https://www.superfluid.finance/post/how-superfluid-protocol-is-empowering-onchain-builders\n\nIf you have any questions or would like to learn more about Superfluid, please reach out to mdali.eth on Warpcast or Twitter/X.",

They can also manage their incoming stream by redirecting it (or splitting it) to team members, third parties or DeFi apps in real time. You can read more about stream redirection and splitting here: https://help.superfluid.finance/en/articles/8907702-how-to-split-your-incoming-rpgf-grant\n\nSuperfluid also enabled smooth funds distribution, management and control for the Optimism team.\n\nThe entire community could benefit from transparent and easy to understand funding process, timeline and status (i.e. https://dune.com/0xkhmer/retropgf-3).\n",

This allowed all stakeholders‚Äîbadgeholders, token holders, recipients, and delegates‚Äîto participate freely without pressure and promote project discovery. We also distributed 4,000 OP as rewards, a 100OP to 40 lucky winners. Here you can find the [final results](https://www.pairwise.vote/rf4-results), and our [blog conclusions](https://paragraph.xyz/@pairwise) for more details on our outcomes.\n\nThe feedback from RF4 was very positive, leading to an invite to build with Optimism for RF5. For this round, we developed a star rating system, enabling participants to assign stars to projects before comparing them.

Pairwise also sparks discussions by comparing its results to official ones, fostering deeper insights and driving more meaningful participation and progress to decentralization.\n\nThe foundation‚Äôs implementation of RetroFunding was clearly informed by our work and [feedback](https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-round-3-feedback-thread/6177/150?u=griff).

We host weekly Respect Game events, featuring a unique onchain social game designed to foster collaboration, award public goods creators, and optimize governance on the Superchain. Between October 2023 and September 2024, we hosted 42 events where participants share their contributions to Optimism, rank each other‚Äôs impact with onchain attestations, and earn non-transferable Respect tokens.\n\nThese Respect tokens create a transparent, peer-reviewed system for measuring governance contributions and impact. Optimism Fractal events are a hub for pioneering fractal democracy on Optimism, providing a scalable model for decentralized decision-making. Through this gamified approach, we're shaping the future of Optimism governance, connecting builders, and community leaders while fostering a culture of active governance participation.\n\nThis project is for the hosting, promoting, organizing, and producing of respect game events, as well as other key processes like community engagement and facilitation of our consensus processes. It does include not the development of tools used at the events or the Optimism Town Hall events which take place after Respect Game events, as there are separate applications for these projects.\n\nThis work has not been funded by the Collective outside of the RetroPGF Round 3 grant shown below, which supported the team who started Optimism Fractal as well as our work with several other related projects. You can see Optimystics.io/projects-and-funding details on our organization‚Äôs funding and applications for related projects.",

The tool streamlines the process, allowing users to take an 11-question survey and match with active, values-aligned delegates, increasing the overall votable OP supply. [Landing page](https://delegatematch.xyz/)\n\nLeveraging Farcaster‚Äôs 650K registered users and 60-100K daily active users, Delegate Match boosts exposure to the OP delegation process. Our Farcaster Frame provides a seamless experience, enabling users to make an informed decision and delegate their tokens in just five minutes. By integrating the Ethereum Attestation Service, Delegate Match supports delegate reputation-building. It provides OP holders and delegates a low-cost, high-impact, innovative delegation tool.

By encouraging broader participation, Delegate Match helps decentralize governance and promotes greater equity among delegates, enabling them to play a more meaningful role in Optimism's decision-making.\n\nWe have a solid foundation and are passionately engaged in exploring innovative solutions in this uncharted territory.

Trusted User Model was introduced to measure the count of users qualified for the Trusted User definition. \n\nSeveral data sources were used to compose the Trusted User definition. The Farcaster user reputation scores computed by OpenRank on an curated engagement graph was used as one of the three major data sources, next to FIDs and Gitcoin Passport. \n\nThe reputation scores are taken from OpenRank Farcaster Global Profile Ranking: Farcaster users are basically categorized into the two strategies: [**following**](https://docs.openrank.com/integrations/farcaster/global-profile-ranking#strategy-following) and [**engagement](https://docs.openrank.com/integrations/farcaster/global-profile-ranking#strategy-engagement), and ranked recursively by incoming and outgoing trusted engagement signals such as recast, comment, likes on their social graph.** This score is made available, open-sourced and verifiable by OpenRank reputation protocol.\n\n[OUR IMPACT]\n\nUsers which rank high on OpenRank scores are acknowledged lost of developers as highly likely to be reputable real users instead of spam, Sybils and scammers. \n\nhttps://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-impact-metrics-a-collective-experiment/8226\nAdditionally, Retro 4 also used a metric called OpenRank Trusted User Model, which indicates an even tougher-defined trust. Therefore it is a good metric to measure the contribution of an app on Optimism. \n\n[WHAT IS OpenRank]\n\nOpenRank is a decentralized ranking and reputation protocol. It enables a verifiable reputation compute layer for the open web that unlocks a broad range of useful applications, including those that resist cryptographic or game-theoretic mechanisms of trust. Using graph compute algorithms like EigenTrust, it offers resilience from sybil contexts, provides scalable and context-specific compute, and enables permissionless access to compute and reputation data for any user.",

In the worst case, we can‚Äôt guarantee that the provided allocation algorithm was even used or that all votes were counted.\n\nWe made this process transparent with zero-knowledge (ZK) proof that legitimate votes were counted and that the allocation algorithm was run as intended, keeping the votes themselves private. Using EZKL, we were able to compile the Python allocation code into a circuit, and provide a proof anyone can verify at https://retrofunding.ezkl.xyz (see https://blog.ezkl.xyz/post/zkrpgf/ for more details).\n\n",

One of the most significant contributions during Season 5 was bringing governor upgrades to on-chain proposals after internal discussions within the ACC. This season also laid the foundation for the ACC‚Äôs operating procedures and long-term role in governance.",

With this frame, users can quickly check who their OP delegate is and re-delegate their voting power if they choose.\n\nIt starts with the ‚ÄúCheck My Delegate‚Äù button, showing key info like wallet address, OP balance, and the current delegate. A user can then pick a new delegate by entering their wallet address, ENS, or Farcaster handle and confirming through their wallet.\n\nOnce complete, the user gets a confirmation with transaction details and can share it with others on Farcaster. The tool integrates Optimism‚Äôs delegation function, making it straightforward for anyone to participate in governance.\n\nThe frame is made by Tempe Techie and Tekr, both delegates and builders in the Optimism ecosystem. We are also very active on Farcaster, which is why we decided to build a tool that is useful to both us and others on Farcaster.",

    "description": "This research aims to improve governance by achieving more effective public goods funding through the comparison of various grant models. Grant programs play a crucial role in the crypto ecosystem, but comparative studies are rare. In this study, we compare different types of programs such as Uniswap, dYdX, Optimism, and Gitcoin, categorizing them into \"top-down,\" \"bottom-up,\" and \"QF (algorithmic)\" types. Our findings suggest that bottom-up and QF types tend to distribute funds more evenly, with smaller grant amounts and less variability, while top-down types exhibit greater variability and tend to provide larger grants to fewer recipients.\n\nThe goal of this research is to achieve a more effective and fair grants program. We aim to uncover the differences among various grant programs and provide insights that could improve future program management. By conducting a cross-comparative quantitative analysis, focusing especially on decision-making bodies, we investigated how grant amounts and the number of grants are influenced by different types of decision-making mechanisms. Looking ahead, we plan to develop tools for impact evaluation, impact measurement, or outcome measurement based on these results. This will enable evidence-based public goods funding by using grants data, ensuring that future grants are more effective and aligned with measurable outcomes.\n\nThis research and development includes Optimism Collective as a subject of investigation, focusing on identifying the unique characteristics of the Optimism Collective, analyzing the current state of its fund distribution, and comparing it with other grant programs. This approach will contribute to designing more effective, evidence-based funding strategies and to realizing the vision of Retro Funding.",

        "name": "A Retrospective Quantitative Review of Crypto Grants Programs",
        "description": "In this survey, I quantitatively compared grant amounts among the programs implemented by Uniswap, dYdX, Optimism, and Gitcoin to find the differences among them. This survey revealed trends based on the characteristics of the grants programs managers (decision-makers). In Uniswap and dYdX, the grants programs are operated by a few arbitrarily selected individuals (top-down type), Optimism is managed by individuals elected or selected based on objective criteria (bottom-up type), and Gitcoin uses a direct democratic method called Quadratic Funding (QF type) where decisions are made by a large number of people. The hypothesis that could be drawn from categorizing these operations is that there is a correlation with the amount of grants. The bottom-up and QF types tend to distribute funds more evenly with smaller variability and smaller grant amounts. Conversely, the top-down type shows greater variability in the amounts received by each grantee, and fewer recipients in general. This means that while bottom-up and QF types distribute grants more evenly, providing a sort of economic infrastructure, the top-down type shows a kind of bias with a greater variability in grant amounts, with fewer recipients receiving larger. This suggests that bottom-up and QF types tend to fund projects with high public utility, whereas top-down types are more likely to fund projects that benefit their own protocols, reflecting a fundamental difference in the underlying motivations of each grants program.\n\nHowever, while the bias introduced by top-down grants may seem negative from a fairness perspective, I consider this bias important. This aligns with traditional economic theory, where governments intervene to provide goods that are difficult to manage in the market. Top-down granters can play a role similar to government intervention, providing funds for projects that fall outside the scope of QF, potentially introducing serendipity in the public goods market. Therefore, the bias in top-down grants programs may bring positive outcomes when viewed from the ecosystem as a whole. There may be a need for environments that produce diverse grants programs aiming to provide public goods based on certain or biased values. At the same time, funding \"outliers\" needs feedback and accountability from the grantee to the grantor, or this means the importance of funding systems based on project outcomes, though general grants programs need too. In the future, measuring the outcomes of grantees can help grantors focus on the types of projects that are most beneficial. Organizations like Venture Grantor, as well as VCs and foundations focused on the provision and maintenance of public goods, will also value this role."

We analyze distribution patterns, such as the size of grants, the number of recipients, decision-making processes, and how evenly resources are allocated, highlighting how Optimism‚Äôs fund distribution differs from other governance models. We have found that Optimism provides relatively larger grants, supports a greater number of recipients, and shows less variation in the amount granted per recipient. We also examine how effective Optimism‚Äôs governance structure is in promoting fair and impactful public goods funding. Additionally, we expect this analysis to lead to the proposal of new types of grants and the measurement and evaluation of impact based on data, contributing to more effective funding practices.",

During Season 5, no Code of Conduct issues were escalated to the Token House, despite multiple submissions occurring during this period. \nIn Season 5, the Council implemented clear processes for handling disputes, including a transparent reporting system that publishes enforcement decisions. Also, confirming and denying grant clawback requests from the grants council smooth lined the process in how teams that hadn‚Äôt met their milestones would be treated. Further, initiatives like GravityDAO‚Äôs conflict resolution training demonstrated the Council‚Äôs commitment to preventative measures, reducing the likelihood of violations in the first place.\n",

This shift has improved governance efficiency, ensuring timely and impartial enforcement of community standards. The introduction of preventative measures, such as conflict resolution training, further supports long-term community well-being.

    "description": "Our project aimed to analyze the distribution and concentration of power within the Optimism Collective's governance structure, using a new metric called the Concentration of Power Index (CPI). Building on the traditional Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), the CPI provided a nuanced perspective by evaluating the voting power of delegates and the roles of various governance bodies, including the Token House and Citizen House. Additionally, we examined the Nakamoto Coefficient to assess the minimum number of members needed to control a majority of voting power, allowing us to compare our findings for the Optimism Collective with those of other prominent DAOs like Compound, Aave, and Uniswap. This research was intended to inform future governance decisions, ensuring the Collective remained fair, transparent, and truly decentralized as it grew and evolved.\n\nOur team consisted of three members who contributed to this project. Chain-l used his experience in the blockchain industry and DAOs to guide the development of the Concentration of Power Index and managed the overall research project. ARDev focused on data analysis, using his skills in ETL processes and Dune Analytics to gather and visualize the data collected, which informed our comparisons with other DAOs. Dhruvi contributed to data visualization to create clear and compelling dashboards that presented our findings in an accessible way, helping to illustrate the power dynamics within the Optimism Collective. Together, our combined efforts ensured a thorough and insightful analysis to be presented to the DAO and community members.",

          "answer": "The above work broadly benefited the Superchain by attracting token engineering projects and expertise to the ecosystem. Interestingly, many of the projects with the greatest TQF boosts also contributed specifically to OP capital allocation and broader governance capacity:\n\n- **Pairwise (94% boost):** Governance voting dApp optimizing decision-making and RetroPGF processes.\n\n- **GovGraph (169% boost):** Visualizes relationships between OP governance participants, enhancing transparency.\n\n- **Superchain Innovation Research (121% boost):** Research on Superchain tokenomics and governance.\n\n- **Breadchain Cooperative (63% boost):** PGF DAI mechanisms for community-driven funding.\n\n- **Inverter Network (53% boost):** Token programmability stack & no-code deployment panel, lowering barriers for token systems on OP.\n\n- **EVMcrispr (47.1% boost):** Simplifies smart contract interactions on EVM chains, making them more accessible.\n\n",

Additionally, we highlighted their newly launched attestation explorer, which allows users to review community impact data, further cementing their role in Optimism Citizens' eligibility processes.

Our approach focused on crafting a comprehensive application highlighting Cantina's established expertise in providing security audits within the Optimism ecosystem, in alignment with Optimism‚Äôs goals of ensuring robust security for the OP Stack. We emphasized Cantina‚Äôs work's impact by showcasing how their security audits for critical components, such as Optimism‚Äôs EAS and cross-chain functionality, contributed to the reliability and safety of the OP Stack.\n\nAdditionally, we illustrated how their continuous monitoring and incident response services supported projects like Omni-x and Decent.xyz, ensuring secure deployment and scalability across multiple chains. In preparing the application, we ensured that Cantina's pricing model and funding history were presented, which justified the need for continued funding. By structuring the application to emphasize Cantina's value as a trusted security partner in the Optimism ecosystem, we helped secure a successful outcome in Retro Funding 5.\n"

    "description": "Who We Are\n\nTribuni was born out of the ETH Denver hackathon, spearheaded by a team of decentralized governance practitioners. Our founding members include delegates from Blockchain@USC actively participating in Optimism's governance. With expertise spanning software engineering, product design, and product management across both Web2 and crypto landscapes, our diverse team is dedicated to enhancing the delegate experience.\n\nOur Story\n\nBeing a delegate requires constantly staying up-to-date due to the sheer volume of information that needs to be digested. Before Tribuni, we experienced firsthand the challenges of managing extensive data and keeping track of vital governance activities. To address this pain point, we engaged with a wide range of delegates from groups such as 404DAO, Brichis, PGov, Launamu, FranklinDAO, etc. Their insights and feedback inspired us to build a tool tailored specifically for delegates like them.\n\nOur Solution\n\nDelegates are the cornerstone of Optimism's governance system. Active and well-informed delegates lead to resilient and sound governance. However, delegates need to process a lot of information and often find it challenging to stay up-to-date. We are humans after all.\n\nTo help delegates stay active and well-informed, our team launched Tribuni‚Äîa free Telegram mini-app built exclusively for delegates. Tribuni sends quality AI-generated proposal summaries, vote reminders, and OP forum activity digests directly via Telegram. This ensures that delegates never miss a vote or an important discussion within the OP ecosystem, as long as they're connected to Telegram.\n\nImpact\n\nAs of September 2024, Tribuni proudly supports 28 OP delegate profiles, encompassing a staggering 28,217,127 votes combined. This substantial vote power not only surpasses Optimism's 26 million quorum but also underscores Tribuni's pivotal role in the governance ecosystem. Our platform serves 38 dedicated Optimism subscribers, including influential entities like PGOV, blockchain@USC, 404DAO, PGov, Gauntlet, Tane Gov, etc who manage multiple delegate memberships. Through Tribuni, we help them analyzed 1,113 posts across 186 forum topics, ensuring they remain well-informed and proactive in decision-making. By seamlessly integrating into their workflows, Tribuni has become an indispensable tool, empowering delegates to govern more effectively and maintain the resilience of Optimism's governance structure.",

    "description": "Open Source Observer is a public good that helps communities measure impact and improve grant effectiveness. During Retro Funding 4 (Onchain Builders), we collaborated closely with the Citizens House to develop a comprehensive suite of onchain impact metrics and power the first \"metrics-based voting\" experiment.\n\nWe created a first-of-its-kind data pipeline for the Superchain: not only the data but also all source code, query logic, and underlying infrastructure is publicly available for use. With data generously provided by Goldsky, we built a unified Superchain event model covering all OP Stack chains (OP Mainnet, Base, Fraxtal, Metal, Mode, and Zora). We wrote custom logic for discovering contract deployments and attributing them to specific projects per RF4 requirements. With our friends at OpenRank, Passport, and the OP Labs data team, we designed a \"trusted user model\", intended to identify transaction and onchain activity from high reputation users. These models provided the foundation for calculating a range of quantitative indicators to assess the contributions of onchain builders across these chains. All methodologies, data sources, and analysis tools used in developing these metrics are publicly available.\n\nWe also maintain an important community resource called OSS Directory: a public repository of Optimism projects and their associated GitHub repos, NPM packages, deployers, contracts, and other open source artifacts, with a strict schema and validation logic to ensure consistency. There are more than 500 Optimism projects in the directory, with new submissions and updates coming in every week. During the RF4 sign-up period, we received 50+ new submissions and made numerous updates to existing projects. \n\nThe journey to arrive at a final set of onchain impact metrics was iterative and collaborative. We worked closely with the Foundation and badgeholders to discover and refine the metrics through workshops, surveys, and asynchronous feedabck. This collaboration not only provided valuable insights for Retro Funding 4 but also laid the groundwork for more sophisticated impact assessment in subsequent rounds.\n\nIn all the work leading up to the final voting, we maintained our commitment to openness and reproducibility, and wrote extensively about the process to arrive at the final set of metrics on our blog and the Optimism governance forum.",

In short giving participants the right context and tools required for writing their own mission request to post for sponsorship.",

In this project, we develop various models of badgeholder behavior that include real-world effects such as varying levels of expertise and laziness, and implement them in an agent-based simulator to simulate various aspects of RetroPGF voting mechanisms. The purpose of these simulations is to test aspects of voting mechanisms quantitatively. Specifically, we are interested in testing how various voting mechanisms (such as Quorum + Threshold, or Pairwise) compare along the following dimensions:  1) capital allocation efficiency, 2) robustness to COI (conflict of interest), and 3) robustness to collusion. \n\nOur summary findings, which are detailed in the project resources, are:\nWhen controlling for badgeholder laziness and expertise, the pairwise voting mechanism results in a closer alignment between true project rankings and the rankings inferred by the voting mechanism.\nQuorum+Threshold, across a wide range of parameters, appears more resilient to COI and collusion than Pairwise.\n",

Our dashboard provides essential governance metrics such as participation rates, voting power distribution, delegates' performance, and voting history. By continuously refining our features based on community feedback, we've enriched stakeholder engagement and informed decision-making processes.\n\nSince last year, we've introduced significant enhancements to the dashboard, including:\n\nCitizen House Integration: We now provide comprehensive data visualization tools for the Citizen House, focusing on Badgeholder analytics and veto proposals. This update enables a clearer understanding of activities within the Citizen House and enhances transparency around proposal results and participation.\n\nRetroPGF Project Analytics: Our dashboard now offers detailed tracking and insights into RetroPGF projects, including an Application Funnel Overview that displays the entire project application process, from submission to decision. We also provide analytics on ongoing and upcoming RetroPGF projects, including RetroPGF 3 & 4, ensuring that the community can better understand and monitor project dynamics and impact.\n\nUI and User Experience Improvements: We revamped the user interface, enhancing the visibility of delegate voting power and improving the navigation bar for easier interaction. Our new delegate card feature allows for more detailed and interactive insights, making it easier for users to track individual delegate activity.\n\nPartial Delegation Integration: We introduced detailed insights into the sources of a delegate's voting power, distinguishing between partial and full delegations. This feature provides a more granular view of each delegate‚Äôs influence within the governance process.\n\nDelegate Ranking Bump Chart: A dynamic tool that visualizes the evolution of delegates‚Äô voting power over various timeframes, offering a detailed view of ranking changes to better understand the governance dynamics.\n\nThrough these updates, the Curia OP Governance Analytics Dashboard has continued to foster a culture of accountability, transparency, and informed governance across the Optimism Collective, empowering stakeholders to make astute, data-driven decisions.",

Traditionally, Farcaster wallet verification data is only accessible through the Farcaster Hub, which cannot be utilized directly on Optimism Mainnet via Solidity smart contracts. This creates a centralization issue in the Retro Funding EAS schema, limiting the authorized attester to a single wallet, as it requires verification from a centralized backend.\n\nFarcaster Attestation resolves this centralization problem by enabling anyone to attest their Farcaster data permissionlessly.\n\nWe have replicated the Retro Funding Project and Metadata Schema to test the integration with Farcaster Attestation.

    "description": "For RetroPGF round 3 we developed a detailed tracker that badgeholders and projects alike used to track their current appearance in ballots, lists by badgeholders and other data. Badgeholders could speed up their voting process and have live-data (every few minutes) how project's ballots have changed. Also how much funding projects had previously received in terms of previous retroactive funding, VC funding and own token issuance.\n\nAfter seeing ongoing discussions on social media around the difficulty of assessing 643 projects by badgeholders, we were addressing major issues like:\n\n- better overview of projects in one list, if they already appear in ballots or lists (made them more visible) and what their median valuation in badgeholder's lists currently is\n- detailed overview of funding reported in their application, plus gathering additional information on outside funding like VC funding, if there is a token of the project, which we made transparent in the tracker. \n- Projects could see if they made the minimum threshold.\n- Everyone could have a complete overview of projects that had applied, search ability and a better way to sort projects by different variables in our list.\n- Link directly to a project on Agora to see the full description allowed for faster navigation. Critical when needing to assess more than 600 projects in a few weeks.\n\nThroughout the voting period, a huge amount of badgeholders and project's representatives used our page and the tracker (topping >1500 users per day) to see what's new. \n\nFeedback we have received (summarized):\n- People appreciated the list view and completeness of data in a transparent and condensed view.\n- Live updates made it possible to see unknown projects better.\n- Some even said that our tracker transformed the whole round into a prediction market through it's live updates and badgeholder's possibility to adjust their ballot throughout.\n\nAfter the voting period people were keen on seeing their result, finding our tracker to see how much they had been allocated. \n\nOn top, throughout the whole time, our tracker has been shared many times by everyone involved in RPGF on socials and diverse platforms, which brought a lot of attention to Optimism and its retrofunding. \n\nThis particular project (i.e. the tracker) has not received any funding from Optimism or any other source.

It was renewed for Season 6 with an expanded scope, and has continued to deliver important results.",
