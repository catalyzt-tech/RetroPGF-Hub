{"name":"Multicall3","description":"Multicall3 aggregates results from multiple contract calls. This reduces the number of JSON RPC requests that need to be sent, which is especially useful if using remote nodes like Infura. This can significantly improve performance and reduce RPC usage. It also guarantees that all returned data is from the same block (i.e. an atomic read) to ensure consistency and accuracy of fetched data.","category":"Tooling and utilities","votedominance":"0.188","totalop":"18,798.99"}
