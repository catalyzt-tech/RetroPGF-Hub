{"name":"Guild","description":"Guild is an infrastructure for platformless memberships and community building. Built around the Guild Model (requirements, roles, rewards), anyone can create modular memberships based on composable on-chain and off-chain data. These can be used to gate off-chain rewards (access to Discord, Telegram, Google folders & files, Github), on-chain rewards (POAP), or custom applications (via our SDK).","category":"Tooling and utilities","votedominance":"0.51","totalop":"51,001.26"}
