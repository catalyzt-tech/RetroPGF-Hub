{"name":"EthernautDAO","about":"We are a developer's bridge from web2 to web3. We pair senior solidity devs with senior web2 devs for a 2-month crash course to expand the blockchain teams. We also started the distribution of a soulbond token called EXP on optimism to have an on-chain attestation of developer contributors.","question_1":"We have provided 34 new developers into the space most of them to the optimism space for free, we are now funding and promoting 2 educational games \"EVM runners\" led by Karmacoma who's mentoring while in prod, and \"Not your Keys\" led by Kethic who is also mentoring while in prod. Both are to be deployed in optimism and we made a Bedrock / OPstack high-level AMA with Kelvin.","question_2":"We live on donations from our mint wepage: https://mint.ethernautdao.io/#donate All the EthernautDAO treasury is in one multi-sig here: 0x2431BFA47bB3d494Bd720FaC71960F27a54b6FE7 There are 5 ETH for maintenance and 108.000 OP tokens that can only be used to pay future mentors and distribution between EXP holders for the next 4 months.","team":"We are a DAO with 7 council members elected every 6 months to avoid calling for votes on every decision. Anyone can run for a council member, to be a voter you just need to provide human proof by making a 1 min vid call with a council member."}
