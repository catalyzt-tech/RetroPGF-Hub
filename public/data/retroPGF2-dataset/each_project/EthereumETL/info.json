{"name":"EthereumETL","about":"EthereumETL has been described as the most useful open-source project for facilitating data science on Ethereum data. In addition, a BigQuery Ethereum dataset published together with Google using EthereumETL has already proved useful for many companies and people: it empowers research and data science, and enables data-driven applications development.","question_1":"EthereumETL is an open-source Python package where you can insert an RPC and a block range, then extract transaction data for any EVM chain. It can be used to extract data from the Optimism chain. EthereumETL powers public Ethereum datasets in Google BigQuery https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/ethereum-bigquery-public-dataset-smart-contract-analytics","question_2":"- The open source tools https://github.com/blockchain-etl/ethereum-etl are sustained by community contributions, as well contributions from companies that use these tools such as Nansen.ai - The infrastructure behind the public datasets in BigQuery are funded by Google and Nansen.ai - GitCoin grant https://gitcoin.co/grants/233/ethereumetl","team":"4"}
