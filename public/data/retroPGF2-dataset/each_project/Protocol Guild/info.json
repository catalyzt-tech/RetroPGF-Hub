{"name":"Protocol Guild","about":"The Protocol Guild helps Ethereum's ecosystem + community fund core protocol development: a foundational Public Good for all. The Guild curates a weighted membership registry of ~128 active contributors, which anyone can donate to via a single Ethereum address. Donations are vested to members over time, creating long-term stewarding incentives. Learn more: https://bit.ly/PG-docs","question_1":"As a rollup, Optimism will leverage Ethereum for settlement & security assurances, as well as new scaling mechanisms like proto-danksharding (EIP-4844). These will reduce rollup user fees while broadening access to Ethereum’s trust assurances. 🌐 The median Protocol Guild member has been active for ~3 years in protocol maintenance and improvements, including the work mentioned above.","question_2":"Just as Ethereum doesn't allocate a % of block rewards to fund Public Goods, the Protocol Guild doesn't have a native source of funding. To help bootstrap PG and its 1 year Pilot, a number Ethereum-based projects provided ~$10mm in funding last year: vesting directly to individuals.
