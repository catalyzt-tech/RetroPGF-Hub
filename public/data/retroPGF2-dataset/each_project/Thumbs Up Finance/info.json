{"name":"Thumbs Up Finance","about":"For almost two years I've been learning everything I can about cryptocurrency and distilling it down to entertaining critiques, deep dives, and tutorials to help people understand and engage with cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and web3 protocols safely and productively.","question_1":"I'm not just a content creator, I'm an outspoken advocate of things like open source, public goods, tools for financial and social equity, and beyond. I aim to provide entertainment and education, but not cliché, boring, nor overly hype-driven content; fun, unique, and entertaining written and video content for people to engage with.","question_2":"I've got a 9-5 job fully separate from crypto. It just barely covers my living costs, student loans etc. Any money I've made in crypto I've made by doing work for DAOs, writing for bounties, grants, and contests (I'm one of the most decorated winners of such programs for 2021/2022). Since the bear market began though, I've had almost no work. I keep grinding though, broke as I have been.","team":"1 person."}
