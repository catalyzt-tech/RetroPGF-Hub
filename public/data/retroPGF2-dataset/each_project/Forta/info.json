{"name":"Forta","about":"Forta is a real-time detection network for security monitoring of blockchain activity. Forta comprises a decentralized network of independent node operators that scan all transactions and block-by-block state changes for outlier transactions and threats. Developers can build detection bots (piece of script that monitors the activity) and machine learning models, and run them on the network.","question_1":"Forta has been scanning Optimism since Q1 2022. There are 296 nodes that are uniquely monitoring Optimism, running 88 bots in total that are watching generic activity, as well as protocols (eg. Perpetual) Many of these bots are watching generic attacks in the chain. For example, the Attack-detector-feed combines over 80 bots to identify patterns and alert when an exploit event is taking place.","question_2":"Forta raised US$23 million in July 2021 in a round led by a16z, which included other notable backers such as Blockchain Capital, Blue Yard and Coinbase Ventures, among others. Forta is currently free, and anyone can subscribe to alerts, or deploy detection bots, without any cost.","team":"The Forta Foundation has 9 full-time staff members, focused on project management, marketing, finance and operations as well as coordinating core developers and the community."}
