{"name":"Sugar","about":"Sugar makes Velodrome devs life sweeter Sugar was born as the need to unify the 10+ contracts handling Velodrome into an easy to use interface with full access to the normalized dataset representing the real-time state of our protocol.","question_1":"Sugar massively reduced our RPC costs and improved our V2 UI/UX. It reduced the development time and maintenance, and allowed to onboard partners into protocol mechanics with minimal effort. Developers are free to use it to integrate Velodrome liquidity pool data and even historical emissions, veNFT status and available rewards or just display the voting distribution.","question_2":"Core contributing dev at Velodrome Finance, other open source projects.","team":"While building sugar I benefited from feedback and reviews from https://github.com/ethzoomer and https://github.com/AkemiHomura-maow"}
