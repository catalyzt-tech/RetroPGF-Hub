{"name":"Kernel","about":"Kernel is peer-to-peer learning environment, growing one block at a time. Traditionally, each block accommodates 250 individuals and runs for 8 weeks. In two years, and after 7 Kernel blocks, there are: - 1,800 Kernel fellows (see more here: https://www.kernel.community/en/love) - 470 Kernel \"adventures\": web3 projects, protocols, writings & research - 70+ Kernel projects who have raised $1MM","question_1":"Kernel curates & deploys foundational crypto wisdom. This is best illustrated by the Kernel Book: https://www.kernel.community/en/learn/ Optimism (Ether's Phoenix) is a big part of that story. We have deployed & taught optimistic contracts, we host co-learning conversations on 4844 (& 4337, prior), encourage deployment on Optimism when appropriate, and have contributed to early OP governance.","question_2":"Kernel is funded by grants (80%), Kernel dues (15%), and donations (5%). We received $625k in the last year in grants, including notable contributions from Filecoin, The Graph, Celo, and Gitcoin.","team":"Full Time Kernel Stewards: 4 - Andy Tudhope: https://twitter.com/cryptowanderer - Salim Virani: https://twitter.com/SaintSal - Aliya Donn: https://twitter.com/aliyajypsy - Vivek Singh: https://twitter.com/vsinghdothings Part Time Contributors: 2 - Angela Gilhotra: https://twitter.com/anggxyz - sidcode: https://www.cyber-physical.space/"}
