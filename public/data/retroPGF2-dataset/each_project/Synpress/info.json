{"name":"Synpress","about":"Synpress is e2e testing framework based on Cypress.io and playwright with support for metamask. It's a pioneer tool in web3 e2e testing with potential to evolve into a decentralized network of test runners (and CI provider) in future. It’s currently used by multiple different projects on Optimism network (~140 repos on Github): https://github.com/Synthetixio/synpress/network/dependents","question_1":"Supporting a project like this is super beneficial to Optimism, as it ensures that developers apps on Optimism are properly tested and that time is used wisely (as manual testing is beyond painful). Jakub have worked 1:1 with devs across Optimism to support them in using Synpress, and he would like to continue developing the project by expanding the scope and features of the tool.","question_2":"Synpress is fully open-source project without funding and revenue.","team":"1; Jakub@Synthetix."}
