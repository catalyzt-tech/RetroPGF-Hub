{"name":"JiffyScan","about":"JiffyScan is the first (and only) block explorer built for EIP-4337 confirming transactions. It shows the transactions as per the new entities introduced: userOp, Bundle, Bundler, Entrypoint, etc. This is needed for the wallets which will onboard users leveraging this new Smart Contract Wallet standard. PS: Candide Wallet is launching on Optimism and we will support its adoption.","question_1":"EThInfinitsm's entrypoint contract is currently undergoing an audit. A number of dedicated folks are building wallets to support this new standard (including Candide launching on Optimism). For this stack, users can visit a missing user-friendly explorer to verify the transactions and understand them better across different entities. JiffsyScan gives this explorer interface to the community.","question_2":"The team is completely bootstrapped and has been sustaining itself by relying on hackathon winnings for the past few months to get by. Since the explorer interface is public goods, we're now seeking grants to continue building the product and get more developers to help us improve the platform.","team":"We're currently a team of three people. Aditya Agarwal - Product Manager & Associate Developer Gautam Sabhahit - Lead Developer Mārtiņš Zemlickis - Designer We want to onboard the following if we manage to receive grants: 1 Front End Engineer to Work on the Interface and add new views 1 Backend Engineer to help build the API stack and call data decoding stack"}
