{"name":"eth.limo","about":"eth.limo is a privacy-preserving ENS gateway, enabling users to access Ethereum-native dApps and content. LIMO represents a shift in dweb adoption by providing an alternative means of accessing ENS resolvable content. LIMO takes public gateway services a step further by enforcing strong privacy guarantees such as never logging IP addresses or engaging in TCP fingerprinting.","question_1":"Currently eth.limo is the only ENS gateway that utilizes CCIP read enabling users to securely & reliably read retrieved data offchain and cross chain. Users can create and manage name records on Optimism at a much lower cost increasing adoption I.E.Optinames.eth. Kwenta which is a synthetics futures exchange also utilizes eth.limo for it's main website which trades entirely on Optimism.","question_2":"eth.limo primarily funds itself via: Ethereum Foundation grants ENS grants Gitcoin grants There is no revenue at the moment since our service is a free public good. We're looking at ways to offer monetized features to users and projects but access to the gateway will always be free.","team":"2 full time employees 2 part time contractors"}
