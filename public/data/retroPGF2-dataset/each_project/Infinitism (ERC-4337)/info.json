A system that enable safe and decentralized access to contract accounts without relying on centralized infrastructure. Our work is used by a growing number of projects on OP and elsewhere. A future version will also use the OP Stack to offer native account abstraction and even better usability.","question_2":"The work is supported by EF grants. There are no revenues.
