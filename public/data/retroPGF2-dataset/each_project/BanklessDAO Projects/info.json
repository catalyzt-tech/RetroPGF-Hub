{"name":"BanklessDAO Projects","about":"BanklessDAO’s mission is to create user-friendly onramps for people to discover decentralized financial technologies through education, media, and culture. To further that mission, BanklessDAO produces educational content via its newsletters and Bankless Publishing on various crypto-related topics, including Layer 2 scaling solutions such as Optimism. We also make use of Mirror/OP functionality.","question_1":"For usage, a number of our projects and contributors publish on Mirror, and make use of the Optimism-enabled mint function. The public good we provide to the Collective is the creation of educational content through our newsletters and articles on the Collective, scaling technologies, and other 101 content. This content has been translated into 6 languages and has reached a wide audience.","question_2":"At present, BanklessDAO projects are largely funded through its Grants Committee in the form of the BANK token. Our newsletters have received sponsorship funding in the past, but we're seeking greater ecosystem funding, in part, to move away from the sponsorship model.","team":"Bankless Publishing, Newsletters, International Media Nodes, and The Rug all have different team sizes, but the core team for many of these projects is less than six. Most of the content is curated in a decentralized manner, so the number of contributors on any given project varies greatly from week to week and season to season. To be clear, this Application is NOT for Bankless Academy"}
