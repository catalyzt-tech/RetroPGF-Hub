We cover all these needs with quality content and events. Today's crypto ecosystem in LATAM follows trends; our goal is to raise the bar of knowledge in this part of the world and provide all the necessary tools so that every participant can feel part of it.","question_1":"Since its inception in 2020, we have provided free quality content on Ethereum's scaling solutions, including Optimism, across different instances, such as writing content, Community Calls, Twitter spaces, and events. Together with our participation as a delegation, we have been informing hundreds of users interested in Optimism about the current state of the network and governance over time.","question_2":"Our organization has no revenue because our content is conceived as a public good and does not sell anything to users. Our operations have been supported through grants such as: - Gitcoin ( $21000) - Uniswap ($15000) - ETHLatam BA QF ($5015) - ETHColombia Devcon ($4569) Some of our events have been supported by specific sponsors for that sole purpose.","team":"Currently, our organization is composed of a team of 6 core team members: - Candu - CryptoChica - Joxes - Nahue - Pacha - Pepo"}
