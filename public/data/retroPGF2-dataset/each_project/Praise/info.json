We help communities become more intelligent, productive and inclusive by providing a simple way for community members to acknowledge, praise and reward each other’s contributions.","question_1":"After Praise is integrated into the Optimism ecosystem, it will increase engagement and productivity within the community by recognizing and rewarding contributions. The implementation of a comprehensive community intelligence, reputation, and rewards system through Praise can also foster a culture of cooperation, gratitude, and growth.","question_2":"The Praise is currently funded and supported by General Magic and Common Stack.
