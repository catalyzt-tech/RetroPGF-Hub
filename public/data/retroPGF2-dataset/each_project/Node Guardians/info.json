{"name":"Node Guardians","about":"Node Guardians is an RPG that caters to seasoned Solidity devs. We provide over 60 hours of Solidity in the form of CTF & programming problems for free. We've built a custom pipeline to evaluate the users code and verify whether it meets certain criteria. Hackers can unlock soul-bound (off-chain) collectibles that represent their progress in the game.","question_1":"Given that the OVM is EVM-compatible, we're providing free resources for Optimism builders to challenge their programming skills, learn and eventually deliver safer / more sophisticated code.","question_2":"Staking commissions : We run validators on PoS chains (Cosmos Hub - Osmosis - Axelar etc) and apply to delegation programs.
