Xfolio DAO has won a grant from Synthetix gDAO and continues to improve their product before opening for a closed beta. The team is currently conducting user case studies and focus groups for it's flagship Web wallet which allows users to track their portfolio on multiple chains, execute cross-chain transfers, initiate P2P trades and more. They are building the wallet from the ground up to ensure onboarding users to the space is as frictionless and smooth as possible. The team believes in giving the control over a platform to the users, so they can navigate the Web 3 space in a simple, intuitive fashion by providing a superior user experience with minimal hand-holding. XFolio team was one of the first wallets/trading platforms to natively support Optimism and its bridge and is confident to continue building as Optimism reduces entry barrier for new users due to low fees, fast transaction finality and full EVM compatibility.","allocation":"-"}
