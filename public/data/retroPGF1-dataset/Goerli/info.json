They're also two of the people that I believe most clearly represent the cypherpunk ethos that the community was started on, an ethos that has taken a back seat to the massive wave of mainstream adoption we're now seeing.\n\nGoerli, a cross-client proof-of-authority Ethereum testnet. Prior to Goerli, there was no testnet available that is both widely usable across all client implementations, and robust enough to guarantee consistent availability and high reliability. \n\nFunding these two for their work on Goerli is not just a show of support to the key infrastructure they've built, but to what they represent, and what we should strive to hold onto in the broader web3 movement. Let's not forget our roots.","allocation":"$35,452"}
