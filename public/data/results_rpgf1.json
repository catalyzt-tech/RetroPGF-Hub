    "question_1": "Amy Finance is born to be a Layer 2 based & LP-friendly Lending Protocol. We have first built on Arbitrum and we believe that deploying on Optimism is a must way for us to achieve a successful lending protocol in L2 ecosystem. We have achieved great performance after our mainnet launch and it’s just the beginning for us. Amy is a fair launch project without a presale and private investor. It will be great if we could receive the grant from Optimism and we’ll have more resources to focus on our product and bring more convenience for Optimism users. \n\nAs a community-driven project, Amy Finance helps users to earn safe and high yields. Users are going to enjoy higher capital efficiency on Amy. By staking assets into the Assembly pool, each LP/Staker will receive the interests generated from lending and leverage trading without any loss. Moreover, users can borrow assets from the pool and conduct margin trading in one app. The transaction fee will be extremely low owing to the L2 native design. The design of Amy Finance can lift the revenue and maintain the same level of fund security as the classic lending protocols do.\n\nAmy Finance has three major parts: Lending, Margin trading and IQ mining. Users are able to enjoy high efficiency and Cex-like trading experiences on Amy Finance. As the main component of Amy Finance, Assembly Pool supplies assets for both margin trading and borrowing purposes, maximizing the utilization of assets for pool contributors. Users who stake assets into Assembly Pool will earn interest generated through margin trading and lending as well as newly minted $AMY token, with zero impermanent loss. \n\nMargin trading on Amy Finance is like using Lego blocks to build on other decentralized exchanges and brokers. Sourcing depth from other L2 exchanges, together with the execution speed of Layer2, Amy Finance offers centralized exchange-like trading experiences for any traders.\n\nUnlike other platforms that use liquidity mining to incentivize early adopters, Amy Finance follows a different path: using NFT for AMY Token Mining to attract early adopters and gamifying mining to make it more fun and enjoyable. Specifically, Amy Finance has issued Golden Cat NFT and IQ mining to gamify users’ mining and diversify their interest.The cats on Amy Finance possess different levels of IQ which are mostly related to their mining power. Amy Finance is more like a proof-of-IQ system where IQ mostly contributes to users’ yields.",

The US government reneged on a commitment to fund such a FinTech project focused on democratizing access to capital and contracts for “Minority Business Development—of which participation covers around 1%. After putting in the work, the Government failing to commit left  the founders stranded. Such is the history of America and it’s Black population. From the inception, leaders promised freedom yet Blacks possess as much wealth in 2020 as they did in 1865, around 1%. Blockchain gave the team a way to create instant liquidity, so that they might transfer to experience honed in catalyzing economic development for underserved and underrepresented groups in a DeFi investment and tokenization platform focused on leveling the playing field. Entrepreneurship is freedom, and crypto is the path to liberation. American ideals and principles will only be made real when technological innovation focused on increasing access to cutting edge liquidity generation is deliberate and intentional in including Black Indigenous People of Color. Culture x capital = community change, hence C4 is the future of DeFi in color. Thank you for your commitment to create more egalitarian outcomes with reverberations for the entire world.",

    "question_1": "Thread is here: https://twitter.com/DAppNode/status/1450390244759584768\n\n-----\n\n📖 Story Time! 📖 \n\n👵 The Origins of DAppNode ⛓️ 🚪 \n\nCC @optimismPBC for Retroactive Public Goods Funding Thread.\n\nIn 2017 @eduadiez @jbaylina @thegrifft realized people were using Web3 the same way the use Web2: \n\n\n1️⃣  Connect to a cloud hosted web\n2️⃣  Build transaction in @metamask\n3️⃣  Knock at the door of a Node-as-a-Service and ask them to broadcast your tx to some network you might not even know.\n\nHow is that different than knocking at facebook's door and ask them please if they would send our message to our friends?\n\nWe *have to* have some trust assumptions with web2, but with web3 we can *own* direct access to the networks we want to interact with. More on that later.\n\nAround the same time, @jbaylina witnessed the Spanish government censoring websites about a Catalan Independence Referendum - They could do it, and they did it! \n\n\nSurely there was a better way to not be at the mercy of the ones with power?\n\nThe breeding ground for @dappnode was at the perfect temperature and this is the brew that was in the 3 founder's heads:\n- Decentralized systems can provide people direct access to information and value transfer. \n\nIt's like connecting directly to The Matrix vs. using an endpoint controlled by the machines in one of the vats. \n\n\n- @IPFS  websites + @ensdomains and you have decentralized, uncensorable web hosting.\n\n- Plus all the advantages of decentralized value transmission systems (crypto), new organization models (DAOs), etc. \n\nThe catch? People need to *run nodes* to \"connect directly\" instead of via a centralizing party. \n\nLet me pause here and say that public endpoints are ✨  our saviours ✨  of course but going to the 🐈  cat cafe and owning a cat 🐱 have different rewards and responsibilities.\n\nSo: Why are people not running nodes?\n1. Needs certain technical knowledge (CLI might seem bread and butter to you, but UIs still rule the world)\n2. Needs dedicated hardware that runs 24/7 (getting out of sync and sync again is a pain, trust me)\n\n\nSo DAppNode was conceived as a way to help ANYONE, regardless of their technical level, be able to OWN their own access to the web3 to create a new, uncensorable infrastructure layer for a new internet. \n\n\n🤑  Free Open Source Software\n✨  Easy to use UI\n🍹   no maintenance (auto-updates)\n🪐  Fully built with decentralized tech (no central servers, or only opt-in services)\n🛠️  SDK for anyone to build on it\n\n\nFor the user, it gives them independence, self-sovereignty. And for the network, it has the added benefit to make it more resilient, by increasing the number of nodes in different setups, countries, ISPs, hardware... you name it.\n\nFor that we got a grant from the @ethereum foundation and @AragonProject - which kickstarted the project. \n\nSince then we've been helping people run nodes, eth2 validators, decentralized storage and websites and helping people OWN their web3 and provide friends and family with access to a new world. \n\nHow many people? That's a good question: we don't know and we don't want to know. We collect NO METRICS and have NO WAY TO KNOW who runs DAppNode. We sell plug-and-play DAppNode boxes, but we don't know how many people are running the software themselves in their own machine. \n\nNeedless to say, this is a no-go for traditional investors 😅 \n\nSo, to sum up: we're building a decentralized infrastructure layer for web3. We make Ethereum more resilient, increasing the amount of decentralized nodes. We empower people to have direct access to web3. We give tools to the home staker.\n#Infrastructure is a #PublicGood.",

When that happened this effort became DecentralizedDataNOW! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4Artm1rmCWE5qYEOTaaPRl4fD5ORXFty\n\n2018-now Rinkeby & xDai Validator\nWe were one of the original 4 xDai Validators to initialize the network with no reward for many years but this public good work has paid off now, as doing good things tends to work out in crypto! We have been part of the Rinkeby Clique since early 2020. We also Validate for the public goods focused projects: IDchain and Trustlines.  \n\n2020-now Giveth.io, the New Giveth DApp\nWe built a simpler donation application that is intended to make it easy for non-profits to start collecting crypto donations in under 10 minutes with no prior knowledge. With Gitcoin funding open source, we are focusing squarely on charities and have big plans to help non-profits take full advantage of the web3 space. https://giveth.io\n\nAnd these are just the highlights... Giveth has been a fixture of the blockchain4good community since we rose out of the ashes of TheDAO 5 years ago and are not going anywhere. Thank you for considering us.",

    "question_1": "Problem:\nPublic goods are the most overlooked web3 opportunity. Federal, state, and local governments in just the US spent $10 TRILLION in 2021 and this cost is growing every year with no clear solution in sight. We have the opportunity to disrupt this sector GLOBALLY & Giveth is positioned to lead the way. Check out this awesome video from ETHDenver describing this problem at length: https://bit.ly/3fFPG0s\n\nOpportunity:\nGiven the crypto market outlook, user and nonprofit adoption growth, and innovations in fundraising, crypto has the potential to become the most powerful philanthropic force on the planet in the years ahead. In 2021, the largest source of charitable giving came from individuals, who gave $326.87 billion, representing 67% of total giving (National Philantropic trust: https://bit.ly/3C5KTgn).\n\nSolution: \nGiveth is using web3 to evolve philanthropy! Our community is focused on Building the Future of Giving using blockchain technology. Our intention is to support and reward the funding of public goods by creating open, transparent and free access to the revolutionary funding opportunities available within the Ethereum ecosystem. \n100% of donations go to projects. Donors are rewarded with GIVbacks. GIV holders can earn a yeild participating in the GIVeconomy. \n\n1. We encourage Decentralization:\nGiveth offers innovative open-source solutions built on blockchain technology, which is inherently decentralized.\nGiveth is pioneering and experimenting with decentralized governance and communication techniques and supporting their adoption by other communities.\n\n2. We promote Altruism:\nGiveth is an open, non-hierarchical global initiative empowering social, environmental and humanistic impact projects with modern technologies.\nGiveth supports many like-minded initiatives that are adding value to the world without necessarily having a direct profit motive.\nGiveth is building a self-sustaining giving economy that encourages and rewards altruistic intention where the collective benefits.\n\n3. We believe in the power of Community:\nGiveth is an inclusive community united around a common goal.\nA community-owned platform, building and developing our DApps based on feedback from our members (snapshot voting, GIVgarden governance, conviction voting).\nGiveth enables trust within communities by increasing transparency and accountability through blockchain technology.\nGiveth proactively reaches out to similar initiatives which we see as potential collaborators, as opposed to competitors.\n\nThus I believe Giveth is a great candidate for Optimisms’ retroPGF in order to support its long-term vision of building the future of Giving!",

Many of these ideas have influenced how rollups communicate to each other and the roadmap for eth2.\n\nAdditionally, they developed the fastest EVM interpreter to date, evmone, a just-in-time compiler for EVM, and a fast, blockchain-focused WASM interpreter named Fizzy.\n\nMore recently, they have created a road map to evolve the EVM into a safer, more powerful platform. A few of the proposals in this suite:\n\n* EOF -- The Ethereum Object Format will allow backwards incompatible changes into the EVM. The potential of this is unlimited, but a few of their initial proposals will allow improved code analysis and reduce execution time.\n* EVM384 -- Native bignum operations that can be used to implement cryptographic primitives efficiently, without having to wait for a precompile.\n* Improved bounds on various aspects of the EVM to improve network safety and simplify some logic that relies on unbounded values.\n\nIpsilon has been a great contributor to the ecosystem for many years. A few hundred words can't account for all the ideas they've had or reviewed, nor the code they've written or reviewed. It's probably safe to say that some member of the team has thoroughly reviewed every EVM change since Spurious Dragon.\n\nI think they are as deserving as anyone to receive a retroPGF.",

    "question_1": "LeapDAO is a collective that formed around the idea of creating a minimal viable plasma implementation in the beginning of 2019.\n\nFrom the start, our governance structure has consisted of a mixture of Gnosis Multisigs and an engaged Holocratic process [1]. \n\n\"Gardeners\", \"Reviewers\" and \"Workers\" collaborated via Slack and GitHub [2] to build one of the first MVP Plasma implementations on Tendermint. We shipped to the Ethereum Rinkeby test network [3]. \n\nLeapDAO members actively participated in the Plasma \"Implementer Calls\" [4, 15] and contributed meaningfully with proposals to the ethresear.ch online forum [5, 6]. \n\nWe, the underwriters, believe that particularly the work around solEVM and LeapDAO founder Johann's post on \"_Why Smart Contracts are NOT feasible on Plasma_\" [6] deserve more recognition as they've informed the future work on Optimism's OVM and rollups [7].\n\nWhile developing Plasma, LeapDAO members engaged in numerous other meaningful activites. We organized a quadratic voting session (\"popup democracy\") at the Volt Deutschland party congress [8]. At cccamp and ETH Berlin Zwei, we deployed \"Planet A\" - a \"serious social game\"[9, 10] to educate on the adverserial effects of the tragedy of the commons.\n\nLeapDAO's .org domain is currently down. Shit happens. We're trying to fix it. But all LeapDAO contributions and token equity have been recorded by the LeapDAO treasury [11]. Through this record, we believe that LeapDAO is uniquely setup to receive retroactive funding by e.g. airdropping rewards to all LEAP token holders [12].\n\nLeapDAO members have since then moved onto other projects in the Ethereum space. 0xhabitat.org is improving governance and runs on a domain-specific rollup called NutBerry [13]. Strudel.finance's aim was to limit Bitcoin's incumbency and CO2 emissions. rugpullindex.com improves AMM staking safety. Social Dist0rtion Protocol has renamed themselves to \"*Social Distancing* Protocol\". EthereumMachineOracle is a spiritual successor of solEVM [14]. Whiterabbit.one aims to decentralize movie streaming and reduce piracy the gentle way. And sushi is delicious, especially when it *flow*s.\n\nMore than anything, with this application, we, the ones that haven't managed to deploy our work onto the Ethereum mainnet, seek to find attribution and recognition for the countless hours and sleepless nights spent on contributing to open source and the Ethereum ecosystem. Hence, we'd love to get retroactive funding for our work.\n\nSigned,\nThe LeapDAO team\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/YMupQQ22ky\n\n### References\n\n- 1: https://app.glassfrog.com/organizations/14849/orgnav/roles/10883348\n- 2: https://github.com/leapdao/meta/blob/05e1570c7fac1a097efaae4f7aab4426be3ca2b3/fundingProposals/Template%20-%20Funding%20Proposal.md\n- 3: https://github.com/leapdao/meta/blob/master/playbook/operations/testnet/README.md#contracts\n- 4: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTKCmYB6ntA\n- 5: https://ethresear.ch/t/plasma-leap-a-state-enabled-computing-model-for-plasma/3539\n- 6: https://ethresear.ch/t/why-smart-contracts-are-not-feasible-on-plasma/2598\n- 7: https://github.com/leapdao/solEVM-enforcer\n- 8: https://twitter.com/leapdao/status/1169921680317341696?s=20\n- 9: https://www.dist0rtion.com/2019/09/18/planet-a-ccc-ethberlin-recap/\n- 10: https://medium.com/ethberlin/introducing-planet-a-the-tragedy-of-the-co%E2%82%82mmons-90e35c229475\n- 11: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SvvfFPNFXntJTOWhHn_-Qj-11IM3qUWosjn6w5aXMlo/edit\n- 12: https://etherscan.io/address/0x78230e69d6e6449db1e11904e0bd81c018454d7a\n- 13: https://ethresear.ch/t/nutberry-smart-contracts-on-layer-2/6126\n- 14: https://github.com/leapdao/EthereumMachineOracle/\n- 15: https://plasma.io/plasma-contracts.html",

We've made amazing progress perhaps best described here https://unchainedindex.io, however if you read our blog posts and white papers here (https://trueblocks.io/) you'll learn a lot about us as well. We've devised a way to build an index of \"every appearance of every address as it appears anywhere on the Ethereum mainnet.\" Furthermore, we've figured out how to share that index to end users in a fair and equitable way where each user carries his/her own burden and shares that burden with others through IPFS. This allows us to create a local-first desktop application that can do 18-decimal place, every-14-second, fully-reconciled accounting on any address.

The platform breaks down traditional barriers to wildlife conservations biggest challenge, funding. It allows individuals and businesses to become a guardian of a unique wildcard NFTs that represents an animal a conservation agency protects in real life. When a guardian buys a wildcard, they must set the price they are willing to sell it for. Every month, the guardian of the wildcard gives a specified portion of the price they are willing to sell that wildcard for, to the conservation agency that helps conserve that animal. At any point, someone can buy the wildcard from them, if they are willing to pay the selling price that was specified because wildcards are always for sale. When someone buys the wildcard, they must set a selling price. The new guardian of the wildcard is then responsible for giving the new monthly donation. And so, the cycle continues the generation of funds for the conservation agencies. Guardians stand to make a profit when their wildcard is bought from them, contribute transparently to wildlife conservation, and display their wildcard NFT artwork. Having already raised over 130,000 USD for 30 conservation agencies since its inception a year and a half ago, Wildcards works and @optimismPBC retroactive public goods funding would enable it to scale, build fiat on-ramps, and channel more funding to more hands-on high impact conservation efforts on the ground.",
