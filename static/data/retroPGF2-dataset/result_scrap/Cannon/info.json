{"name":"Cannon","description":"Cannon is an 'Infrastructure as Code' tool (like Terraform) for Foundry and Hardhat. Users generate Cannonfiles instead of deploy scripts for a declarative approach to managing protocols, including upgrades and configuration. Deployment information can be shared on the registry (hosted on Ethereum and IPFS) to be used in other Cannonfiles and run for local testing and development.","category":"Tooling and utilities","votedominance":"0.9024","totalop":"90,241.42"}
