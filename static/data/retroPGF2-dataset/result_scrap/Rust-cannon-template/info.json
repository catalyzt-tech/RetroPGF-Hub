{"name":"Rust-cannon-template","description":"The Rust Cannon template is a starting point for developers who want to build and experiment with the provable execution layer of the OP stack. It makes it simple to compile Rust code to MIPs with helpers to read inputs, write outputs and access the pre-image oracle. The results of the execution of this code can be fraud-proven on-chain using the OP stack challenge game Solidity contracts.","category":"Tooling and utilities","votedominance":"0.06","totalop":"5,995.93"}
