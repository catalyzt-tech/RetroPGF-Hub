One of the biggest surprises facing new contributors is the tax liability they take on when accepting tokens for their work. The 2021 tax season was especially bad, as token prices fell by 80-90%, leaving contributors with a hefty, surprise tax bill and reduced ability to pay.  Many contributors walked away from the space entirely.\n\nTo solve this, Taxman allows anyone to calculate their DAO income taxes in their own fiat currency in 10 minutes.  DAO contributors can set aside taxes as they earn, avoiding a surprise tax bill, giving them piece of mind to continue contributing to they web3 projects they love.",

    "contributionDescription": "Adding IPFS support in CURL took 506 days (see contribution PR link) which landed in the 8.4.0 release. Available as of Oct 11th 2024.\n\nThis contribution is two-fold.\n\n1. It allows a user to set an IPFS gateway to use for IPFS URLs (ipfs:// and ipns://). If a local node is installed and running, curl will try and find it's configured gateway without any additional user configuration.\n\n2. It translates IPFS URLs internally to the defined (or detected) gateway thus giving the user a smooth IPFS usage experience without them ever seeing the gateway part of a URL.\n\nThese additions to CURL make it accept the IPFS URLs without the need to prefix them with a gateway (a central point of entry).",

Ideally you want the user to specify just the IPFS parts, the gateway needs to be a configuration. The changes made in curl 8.4.0 do exactly that. Users can now use an IPFS URL like this:\ncurl ipfs://bafybeigagd5nmnn2iys2f3doro7ydrevyr2mzarwidgadawmamiteydbzi\n\nThe gateway is effectively reduced to a configuration detail. Users of curl now don't need to share the gateway anymore and can instead use plain simple IPFS URLs.\n\nCURL is estimated to be installed at ~20 billion places making this a potential huge impact for IPFS adoption and another step in a more distributed world.",

Our mission is to foster learning and collaboration and provide opportunities to African builders. \nWe hosted the largest Ethereum-based hackathon conference in East Africa, a notable event in both 2022 and 2023. These conferences provide a platform for developers based in Africa to showcase their skills and develop solutions for the collective with a focus on problems based in Africa. Binance Smart Chain is the most widely used blockchain in Africa, and through these events, the community is introduced to alternatives that highlight the advantages of OP L2 as a fast, cost-effective option.

Our members, including core contributors, often face economic barriers to financial inclusion. Since our last ETHSafari in 2022, our community has substantially grown.

The service has been well loved on Ethereum mainnet (over 25k users, 300k transactions a month, over 150M assets under monitoring), and we are so excited to bring Webacy safety tools to the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nWallet Watch allows users to monitor all of their wallets and accounts, receiving real time SMS and email notifications whenever ANYTHING interacts with their wallet. This means inbound and outbound transactions, airdrops, royalty payments, and even things like spam drops, drains, and other potentially malicious transactions. We believe knowledge is power. We're so excited to bring these self-custody safety tools to Optimism, making the chain safer for users!",

Now any user on Optimism can monitor interactions, transactions, and assets on-chain, for as many wallets as they'd like!

Another World showcases a simplified UX for both web3 and web2 players to enter a 3D world. Web3 players opt-in by typing in ENS at the entry menu while web2 users are free to play using an URL. \n\n4. Our progress and game sample codes are open-source on GitHub.",

Instead of pairing wETH-YFI or USDC-stERN, wBLT allows bluechip capital to be put to work and earn additional revenue for the LP/protocol in addition to pool2 rewards. wBLT as a paired asset composed of multiple bluechips and stablecoins may also reduce single-asset price volatility risk.

Rewards were issued as NFTs with each consecutive campaign outperforming the one before it. \n\nMost recently, we participated in the Permissionless hackathon where we integrated Gitcoin Passport data including Stamps attestations on OP. We helped users visualize their Passport journey, incentivized them to add more Stamps (attestations on OP), and unlock Gitcoin’s RPGF matching pool.",

This summer, we launched CoSoul, our first SoulBound token and reputation primitive contract, on the Optimism network. CoSouls store metrics to make the value added by contributors using Coordinape visible, as they attest to each other's collaborations in DAOs, projects and companies. CoSoul's launch exceeded our expectation. 26,000 contributors to web3 have minted the SBTs since June. This has resulted in 46,000+ transactions, as CoSouls are synched each month with data from Coordinape, adding more clarity to the reputation map on OP.  CoSoul's have already introduced Optimism to new web3 users, and some notable web2 companies (iFood and The Many) are using Coordinape and CoSouls to kick-start Web3's impact on their orgs.",

Then, they vote to distribute the funds among the verified submissions with a plural voting round.\n\nZengo results from R&D around urban governance and retroactive funding carried out by zenbit.eth. This process started with the Cities Protocol in 2021 followed by CiudadesDAO in 2022. In the same year, We started to test Optimism, deploying RegensDAO, and Eneagon, and now, in 2023, we are integrating these solutions with Zengo in the OP Goerli testnet.",

    "contributionDescription": "\nChronicle labs, formerly the Maker Oracle team, along with the Maker Protocol Engineering team developed a native DAI bridge named \"Teleport\" in 2022. The infrastructure allowed for \"fast withdrawals\" of DAI from L2 to L1 for the first time. The first deployments went live on Optimism and Arbitrum in November 2022 allowing Optimism users to transfer DAI from L2 to L1 instantaneously. Teleport utilized off-chain Oracle Feeds to communicate between L1 and L2, providing cross chain communication messaging. Significant engineering time and resources (6 months/1,920 hours) from the Chronicle Oracle team contributed to the development of the first, trustless Dai bridge, providing users with the advantage to withdraw L2 funds near instantly by avoiding the need to wait for fraud proofs. \n\n",

    "impactDescription": "The development of a canonical DAI bridge following the launch of Optimism offered an important technical improvement for Optimism users as the 7 day fraud-proof waiting requirements were able to be bypassed for the first time. Bridging of a fully composable, top stablecoin like DAI, instead of relying on wrapped versions and non native bridges, aimed to provide better security and a frictionless experience on Optimism. Since the deployment of Teleport (with an initial $1M debt ceiling for DAI mint/burn set by governance), Maker governance has voted to change its multi-chain product roadmap, resulting in the pausing of Teleport. However, Chronicles research, development and deployment of Teleport demonstrate a considerable amount of time and commitment to supporting Optimism.  \n\n\n",

Our current focus is on scaling the protocol via layer 2's such as Optimism. \n\nThe current long-standing effort is to hard fork Ethereum to introduce a new and significantly cheaper way for Layer 2's to reconcile with the base layer. This effort is known as the Deneb hard fork. \n\nAs of this writing we have officially merged our branch that supports the Deneb functionality into Lighthouse's unstable branch (links in this application).  This signifies the collective hard work of the team over the past year and we are on to thorough testing of the changes ahead of the official hard fork.\n\nDuring testing we expect to have more direct interaction with the optimism team to ensure optimism works as expected in this new regime.",

To my knowledge, E2PG + RLPS is the quickest way to get data from multiple L2 chains into a Postgres database. I don't believe any of the hosted API providers are as easy to setup or are as fast as RLPS to index historical data.",

Additionally, the Twitter thread featuring Opclave gained over 600K views, contributing to the popularity of OP Stack\n\nThe Clave team proposed EIP-7212 to enable the use of the P256 curve. Following this, many individuals from the ecosystem began development on the P256 curve. The Ledger team further developed the work of Opclave. Extensive discussions took place on builder forums, and numerous tweets were posted on Twitter regarding EIP-7212",

The hope is for the program to help the Ethereum and Optimism communities become more \"protocol literate\" and have a better theoretical understanding of how protocols work. ",

SoP aims to give the OP Collective the tools to get better at the latter. \n\nSoP is also a way for the Ethereum community to engage with experts outside of blockchain that want to also better understand protocols for their domain of interest, and build bridges with communities we may otherwise not be able to.

By default, wallets only supported mainnet or required users to manually add an RPC to interact with L2s. Wallet balances were siloed by network, causing friction when using multiple chains and leading many users to perceive their OP assets as secondary to their assets on mainnet.\n\nSince 2021, Rainbow Wallet has prioritized its support for L2 networks and introduced new design patterns that dramatically improved their usability. Rainbow was first to offer native L2 support (without having to manually add RPCs), implement frictionless in-app swapping and bridging between networks, and establish a multinetwork UI that consolidates mainnet and L2 assets - now the UX standard for many wallets.",

Pheasant Network is unique in that it is significantly cheaper and faster than other bridges because it handles transactions optimistically.\n\nWe already support networks that leverage the Op Stack, such as Base. In the future, when Op Stack networks explode, we believe that not only native Op Stack bridges, but also optimistic bridges will be indispensable. This is because optimistic bridges are currently the cheapest and fastest of all bridge types. We will continue to contribute to the Optimism ecosystem by actively bridging the Op Stack ecosystem.",

With these deployments, everyone transacting on Optimism or Base can now utilize fully composable verified endpoints for 1.8m+ nonprofits in 150+ countries. To kickstart adoption, we deployed contract addresses for 7000+ verified organizations on both networks. Endaoment also supported other new OP stack chains, having contributed to governance and ideation around Gitcoin’s PGN. Since launch in 2020, Endaoment.org has delivered $58M+ impact for social good, making philanthropy as native to blockchain as DEXs and DAOs. We are excited to be early supporters of the Optimistic Vision and the Superchain. ",
